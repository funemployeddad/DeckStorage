A. hijack the submit event of our form
B. take the form data and send it to the server as a AJAX Post request
    -how do we know the URL of that POST request
C. take the data from the AJAX POST request and create the corresponding deck
D. Send back HTML/JSON of the deck that was created and inject it into the deck into the decks-index


1. make a save deck button on the deck show page, then in the decks_controller have it just render decks index instead of redirecting




2. Need to use a form to render a new resource without refreshing the page
  - hijack the submit action of the form already in use for decks#new
  - look at the ES6 Template Literals for this one

3.  Translate JSON response into JS Model Objects
  - must have at least one method on the prototype. (formatters are a good use of this type of functionality)

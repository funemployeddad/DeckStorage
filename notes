1. I want to load(or render?) <div class="decks"> on doc load
  $(function(){
    var $decks = $.get("div.decks");
  $("div.decks").html($decks);
  })

2. Need to use a form to render a new resrouce without refreshing the page
  - hijack the submit action of the form already in use for decks#new 
  - loot at the ES6 Template Literals for this one 

3.  Translate JSON response into JS Model Objects 
  - must have at least one method on the prototype. (formatters are a good use of this type of functionality)

[master 8dcb80b] new card form works again. now i need to get the delete card buttons back and then the delete deck buttons back. after that is to AJAX a new deck, but need to figure out how I'm going to satisfy the prototype req first

2. Need to use a form to render a new resource without refreshing the page
  - hijack the submit action of the form already in use for decks#new
  - look at the ES6 Template Literals for this one

3.  Translate JSON response into JS Model Objects
  - must have at least one method on the prototype. (formatters are a good use of this type of functionality)
